# Things I want To Do

## XDG cache on tmpfs

Move XDG_CACHE_HOME to tmpfs. Will need the ability to still override some apps to a persistant XDG_CACHE_HOME is they misuse the cache dir.

## refactor out inline scripts

Inline scripts are hard to write and sanity check. Lets move zshrc and nvimrc and all out to their own files.

## monitor Bambu printer

Bambu Lab has an MQTT API, hook it up to grafana.
